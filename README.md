# SAMLab
Herein are notebooks and functions for generating label images from predictions created after predicting from the Segment Anything Model provided through ultralytics. The notebook "SAM\_To\_Label\_Images.ipynb" demonstrates how this works.

## Usage 
First, install ultralytics into a conda environment or with pip.

For example, to initialize and activate a new conda environment, as well as install the relevant packages
`conda create --name ultralytics-env python=3.8 -y`

`conda activate ultralytics-env`

`conda install -c pytorch -c nvidia -c conda-forge pytorch torchvision pytorch-cuda=11.8 ultralytics`

The function "make\_label\_image.py" inputs the masks generated by ultralytics and generates a label image from it. These are easier to interoperate with, and are not (currently) directly exportable from ultralytics.

So far, I've tested this on 2-dimensional RGB PNG and TIF images.

I hope this helps you with segmenting your images!
